            Hello! I'm a passionate software developer with a love for creating interactive and dynamic web applications. 
            My journey started a few years ago when I began exploring front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
            Since then, I've expanded my skill set to include frameworks such as React and backend development with Python.
          </p>
          <p>
            I enjoy problem-solving and continuously learning new tools and technologies. My goal is to build modern, 
            user-friendly web applications that make life easier for people. When I'm not coding, I love reading tech blogs, 
            experimenting with new software, and exploring the world of AI.
